My first go at Advent of Code!

Notes below relate to the things I learned and the problems I had.

#### Day 1
‚≠ê My regular expression struggled with "twone", which made me laugh once I eventually realised that was the problem!\
‚≠ê It matched "two" and then only "ne" was left so "one" got ignored üò•\
‚≠ê Fixed by re-setting lastIndex after each match

#### Day 2
‚≠ê More regular expressions üßô\
‚≠ê I liked being able to re-use my findMaxValue() function in puzzle 2

#### Day 3
‚≠ê Regular expressions saved me yet again, this time from "undefined"!\
‚≠ê My first time trying to solve a puzzle in a 2D array

#### Day 4
‚≠ê Year of the regex! I have found https://regex101.com/ very useful

#### Day 5
‚≠ê Today I learned to read instructions properly rather than just making assumptions...!\
‚≠ê Starting to feel quite challenging, I hope to persevere with at least the Part 1s for as long as possible

#### Day 6
‚≠ê Phew! Today felt quite manageable and less brute force-y than yesterday thanks to some maths üòé\
‚≠ê It's fun to think about a more efficient way to solve a problem

#### Day 7
‚≠ê Not too proud of today's extremely messy code\
‚≠ê However I used a custom sort function for the first time which was fun to figure out!

#### Day 8
‚≠ê More maths! I looked up a function to calculate LCM for several numbers at once.\
‚≠ê I feel bad for the ghost who has to take ~10^13 steps to get where they're going...

#### Day 9
‚≠ê I liked this puzzle, working with sequences is fun for me for some reason\
‚≠ê Maybe I'll regret saying that soon!

#### Day 10
‚≠ê I find 2D array puzzles really tricky, so I'm glad to be able to practice them!\
‚≠ê AoC subreddit helped me think of a way to solve part 2 involving parity of vertical sections of pipe

#### Day 11
‚≠ê Another 2D array puzzle, more practice for me\
‚≠ê Tried to brute force at first, got my first ever 'out of memory' error\
‚≠ê Figured out I could modify the coordinates by adding 999999 instead of trying to iterate through a 2D array with millions of rows and columns... !

#### Day 12
‚≠ê I'm already missing the 2D array puzzles üòÇ\
‚≠ê I used loads of help for today\
‚≠ê I learned about memoization and keeping a cache of calculations that had already been done\
‚≠ê and about recursion, which I used to follow all the possible "branches"

#### Day 13
‚≠ê My wish granted so quickly, another 2D array puzzle... with transposition!\
‚≠ê I think I might actually enjoy these now\
‚≠ê Used two counters to increment "up" and "down" (makes less sense for the transposed version) from the curent index and check for equality

#### Day 14
‚≠ê I definitely feel 1000000000x more confident with 2D arrays now\
‚≠ê Today was a bit frustrating and I tripped up a few times because of array indexing!

#### Day 15
‚≠ê I liked today, pretty straightforward parsing the input then making a hashmap (just an object in JS) for calculations
