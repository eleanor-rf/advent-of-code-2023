My first go at Advent of Code!

Notes below relate to the things I learned and the problems I had.

## Day 1
⭐ My regular expression struggled with "twone", which made me laugh once I eventually realised that was the problem!\
⭐ It matched "two" and then only "ne" was left so "one" got ignored 😥\
⭐ Fixed by re-setting lastIndex after each match

## Day 2
⭐ More regular expressions 🧙
⭐ I liked being able to re-use my findMaxValue() function in puzzle 2
