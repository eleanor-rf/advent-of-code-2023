My first go at Advent of Code!

Notes below relate to the things I learned and the problems I had.

#### Day 1
⭐ My regular expression struggled with "twone", which made me laugh once I eventually realised that was the problem!\
⭐ It matched "two" and then only "ne" was left so "one" got ignored 😥\
⭐ Fixed by re-setting lastIndex after each match

#### Day 2
⭐ More regular expressions 🧙\
⭐ I liked being able to re-use my findMaxValue() function in puzzle 2

#### Day 3
⭐ Regular expressions saved me yet again, this time from "undefined"!\
⭐ My first time trying to solve a puzzle in a 2D array

#### Day 4
⭐ Year of the regex! I have found https://regex101.com/ very useful

#### Day 5
⭐ Today I learned to read instructions properly rather than just making assumptions...!\n
⭐ Starting to feel quite challenging, I hope to persevere with at least the Part 1s for as long as possible
